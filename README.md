## Introduction
This is an analysis of the Northwind Trader. As a BI Developer, I'm crafting a dynamic KPI dashboard in Power BI for our global import/export company. Stay tuned for insights on sales trends, product performance, key customers, and shipping costs. I analyze data from Categories, customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees tables.

*Disclaimer:* This is not a real company dataset. This Database was compiled by Microsoft for learning purposes.

## Objective
 To build a top-level KPI dashboard for the executive team which would allow them to quickly understand the company's performance in key areas, including:
- Sales trends
* Product performance
+ Key customers
- Shipping costs

## Data Source
This Dataset was gotten from Maven Analytics Website.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
* The Data set consist of seven tables (Categories, customers, products, orders, order details, shippers, and employees tables).
* The seven data was loaded into powerbi and was transformed in Power Query.
* The columns were already cleaned as the quality appeared to be 100%.
* The first columns were made headers.
* Some columns were added, removed and renamed.
* Dax was created to get the Revenue.
* Close and apply was done to return back to Power Bi.

## Data Modelling
A many to one relationship was automatically created by Power Bi which goes well with the insight i am to generate. Below is the Mdelling table
