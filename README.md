## Introduction
This is an analysis of the Northwind Trader. As a BI Developer, I'm crafting a dynamic KPI dashboard in Power BI for our global import/export company. Stay tuned for insights on sales trends, product performance, key customers, and shipping costs. I analyze data from Categories, customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees tables.
